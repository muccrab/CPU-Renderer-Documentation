            Making Custom Shaders
        </h1>
        <p class="alltext ptext">
            As I have said users are able to make their own shaders.
            To do that, you have to extend <b>IVertexShader</b> interface for Vertex Shader,
            or <b>IFragmentShader</b> interface for fragment shaders. Both of them are extension
            of <b>IShader</b> interface, that contains method <b>execute</b> that takes <b>ShaderFunctions</b> object,
            that help you for instance with texture loading on your shaders.

        <h2 class="alltext h2text">Render Pipeline</h2>
        <p class="alltext ptext">
            To understand custom shaders, you must first understand how render pipeline works.
            In my renderer I did not try to reinvent the wheel. If you have understanding of openGL pipeline,
            it does not differ at all.
            First it runs vertex shader on all vertices. Then, it rasterises the triangle according to frame buffer,
            and interpolates values using barycentric coordinates to each fragment. It then runs each fragment and draws pixel
            to framebuffer.
            <br>
            Here is an image how it works:

        <h2 class="alltext h2text">Input Variables</h2>
        <p class="alltext ptext">
            Values that are gotten from the previous step in the pipeline.
            <br>
            - In Vertex Shader, they are the vertex data from vertex buffers.
            <br>
            - In Fragment Shader, they are interpolated data gotten from the vertex shaders.
            <br>
            These are the rules of the Input variables:
        </p>
        <ul class="alltext list">
            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    They must have attribute <b>InputAttribute</b> set.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    They must be declared public and be of value type
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    InputAttribute must have declared name.
                    <br>
                    - In Vertex Shaders, the name is basicaly pointless,
                    but serves as a good way to separate your variables.
                    <br>
                    - In Fragment Shaders, it must be the same as the name of the OutputAttribute
                    of the VertexShader output variable
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    Position is important to set in VertexShaders only.
                    If set, it will sort variables according to their values.
                    Every other attribute without set position will go after set ones.
                    <br>
                    <i>Note: The position is just relative to other set ones. 
                    If you have attributes with positions (a: 5, b: 10, c: 2), their real position will be set (a: 2, b: 3, c: 1).</i> 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="alltext h2text">Output Variables</h2>
        <p class="alltext ptext">
            Values that are outputed from shaders to process in the next step in the pipeline.
            <br>
            These are the rules of the Output variables:
        </p>
        <ul class="alltext list">

                <p class="alltext">

            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    In Vertex Shader, their name must match the name of InputAttribute in Fragment Shader. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="alltext">
                    <b>In Fragment Shader it is possible to have only one Output Variable.</b> (Otherwise the linking process will fail)  
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="alltext h2text">Uniform Variables</h2>
        <p class="alltext ptext">
            Values that are uniform accross whole render pipeline.
            They can be set from outside of render pipeline though ShaderProgram variable.
            <br>
            <b>Though possible, it is highly recomended to not set them in shaders, since it could lead to
            racing conditions and data missmatch.</b>
            <br>
            These variables are useful when setting textures samplers, but also for other static data.
            <br>
            These are the rules for Uniform Variables:
